* [Anomaly Detection / Outlier Detection](https://github.com/ksoni5/Anomaly-Detection) - I took two approaches:
    1. <b>Statistical modelling</b> where I created a <b>Gaussian model from scratch</b>. I trained the model with important features as well as utilised <b>PCA</b> to create new features. 
    2. <b>Supervised learning</b> where I created a <b>Gaussian Naive Bayes</b> model and a <b>Random Forest Classifier</b>.
