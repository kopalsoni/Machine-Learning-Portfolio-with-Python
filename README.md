* [Anomaly Detection / Outlier Detection](https://github.com/ksoni5/Anomaly-Detection) - I took two approaches: <br>1. <b>[Statistical modelling](https://github.com/kopalsoni/Anomaly-Detection/blob/master/Statistical%20approach%20-%20Gaussian%20Model%20from%20scratch.ipynb)</b> where I created a <b>Gaussian model from scratch</b>. I trained the model with important features as well as utilised <b>PCA</b> to create new features.<br>2. <b>[Supervised learning](https://github.com/kopalsoni/Anomaly-Detection/blob/master/Supervised%20Learning%20-%20Gaussian%20NB%20and%20Random%20Forest.ipynb)</b> where I created a <b>Gaussian Naive Bayes</b> model and a <b>Random Forest Classifier</b>.


* [Image Classification](https://github.com/kopalsoni/Image-Recognition) - The work is in progress.
